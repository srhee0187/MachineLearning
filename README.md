# MachineLearning
Stanford University - Machine Learning by Andrew Ng from Coursera.  
This repository records the progress of my lab assignments from the Coursera Machine Learning course.  
However, it is mainly a placeholder for my Coursera certificate, and includes a submodule reference to a private repository that actually contains the completed assignments.
